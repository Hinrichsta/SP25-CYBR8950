# Meeting Notes â€“ 04/10/2025

## Meeting with Hale
- Feedback for the project isn't quite ready yet.
- How do we want to publish this?
    - Actual Peer review?
    - Self publish and Public domain?
    - Publishing is not required, if we don't want to release it then we don't have to.
        - We do need to think about it and decide what we want to do.
        - We could just leave it on the github if we wanted to.
- Paper format is not required.
    - If we want to self publish to venue there may be templates for them.

## Team Meeting
- Wait for feedback, but keep plugging away on research
- Probably not going to publish, discuss more on Thursday when we have the options from Hale.
