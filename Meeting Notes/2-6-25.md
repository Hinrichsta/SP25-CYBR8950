During our Milestone 1 meeting, our team worked collaboratively on the project's groundwork by addressing several key tasks. We worked on the GitHub repository as a group by creating the necessary files, updating the files with the first few requirements, and setting up a Kanban task board to organize our workflow. Worked together on drafting a preliminary project timeline proposal and conducting a risk analysis to identify and rank potential challenges. We agreed to reconvene on Monday to follow up on these items and ensure our progress remains on track.

We assigned specific tasks to individual team members for further developing our project methodology, outlining the resources needed, organizing our project management structure, and planning the recording of our presentation. For the project methodology section, we discussed the importance of best practices. Our methodology will include two major components: a literature review and a technical plan.

For the literature review, we agreed to survey a broad range of topics relevant to IoT device security, ensuring that we cover key research and development work in the field. We will identify important keywords based on categories of IoT devices and review relevant research papers. Discussed our technical plan and what we need to provide for our Lit Review. 

The meeting was productive, with clear action items distributed among team members to ensure a strong start to our project. We are confident that our detailed discussion on the project methodology has set us on the right path to meet the rigorous requirements of our capstone, and we look forward to reviewing our progress in our follow-up meeting on Monday after meeting with the instructor.
