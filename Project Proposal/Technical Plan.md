    - Weaknesses Sub-Tasks:  
        1. Gather IoT device breach data
        2. Find Major and minor breachs
           -  Gather details on the devices, time, manufacturer, and the nature of the vulnerability
        3. Apply our categorization to these data points
    - Manufacturer Sub-Tasks:  
        1. Find manufaturer responses to the vulnerabilities/data breaches
        2. Create a categorization as to how appropriate the response was
        3. Categorize each vulnerability/breach by how well the manufacturer responded

- Week 5-6 - Investigate Consumer IoT Management Challenges  
  Objective:  Research and produce a table of the 3 common platforms

 Objective: Review papers to determine what consumers (not researchers) feel are the biggest security and privacy concerns with IoT devices.  Draft guidelines and questions a consumer should ask themselves about a device before purchasing it. Draft guidelines and questions a consumer should ask themselves or research with the vendor about a device before purchasing it.
   
    - Sub-Tasks:  
        1.  Decide between doing this for common devices types, or specific devices.
