    - Sub-Tasks:  
        1. Gather IoT device breach data
        2. Find Major and minor breachs
           -  Gather details on the devices, time, manufacturer, and the nature of the vulnerability
        3. Apply our categorization to these data points

- Week 4-5 - Evaluate Manufacturer Security Practices  
Objective: Look at the issues that Manufacturers have have had with their devices, what their response was, and how many people were affected by them. 
   
    - Sub-Tasks:  
        1. Find manufaturer responses to the vulnerabilities/data breaches
        2. Create a categorization as to how appropriate the response was
        3. Categorize each vulnerability/breach by how well the manufacturer responded

- Week 5-6 - Investigate Consumer IoT Management Challenges  
  Objective:  Research and produce a table of the 3 common platforms
   
    - Sub-Tasks:  
        1. Alexa
        2. Google Home
        3. Apple HomeKit
        4. Maybe HomeAssistant (advanced)

- Week 6-7 - Develop Best Practices for Consumers  
 Objective: Review papers to determine what consumers (not researchers) feel are the biggest security and privacy concerns with IoT devices.  Draft guidelines and questions a consumer should ask themselves about a device before purchasing it. Draft guidelines and questions a consumer should ask themselves or research with the vendor about a device before purchasing it.
   
    - Sub-Tasks:  
        1.  Decide between doing this for common devices types, or specific devices.  
        2.  Decide if we should include recomended vendors (some are much better than others).
