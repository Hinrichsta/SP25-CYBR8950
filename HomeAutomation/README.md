| Requires Constant Internet Connection | Yes | While there is local storage in cameras it cannot be accessed.  All video must be stored and accessed from the internet. |
| Requires Constant Connection to Company Cloud Infrastructure | Yes | The only location that you can access the videos is from the Google Nest/Home apps, and all video is constantly uploaded there for analysis for events. |
| Data Storage Requirements | Cloud | Local storage is minimal, is used for when there is network or power loss, and cannot be accessed.  All video must be stored in the cloud to be usuable |
| Data Gathering Risk Score | 1 | Google is always gathering data, and notoriously gathers as much as possible.  They utilize video sent to their cloud to grow their services and to gather data on their users.  Once you are a part of the ecosystem everything you do with that account is tracked even beyond just the cameras |
| Company Vulnerability Remediation Score | 3 | Google purchased Nest back in 2014, and suffered a major breach of all customers 5 years later.  They appear to be on top of their security since then, but you cannot check their updates prior to 2022 |
| Company Vulnerability Transparency Score | 3 | Their bug bounty program is great and is quite active both from the user and company point of view.  They are lacking in notifications prior to 2022 which is concerning that these started 3 years after their major breach.  They do post all of their updates with the CVE number that can be checked and verified. |
