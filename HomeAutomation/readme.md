# Home automation

## Tuya/SmartLife switches and bulbs.  
- SmartBulbs and switches fall largely into the same device category.  The exception would be their are smart bulbs which contains a speaker/microphone, and they would be included under entertainment->speakers.  
- Tuya is the parent company, which provides a a [SaaS and device certification program](https://www.tuya.com/platform/vas/works-with) for hardware manufacturers.  They also market their own devices under the SmartLife name.  

## Temperature and other sensors
- GoveeLife operates a similiar Saas service to Tuya/SmartLife, but they don't sell this service.  They offer different products under different iterations of the Govee name, GoveeLife/Home/SmartLife (confusing), etc.  
- Low power temp sensors are typically bluetooth, and connect to a WiFi gateway.  However they can operate with just the Govee application and Bluetooth, eliminating the cloud requirement, but they require cloud for setup.  This limits features, and data retention.  

## Utec/UHome/ULTRALOQ Locks
- Several different models of locks are offered.Local options unclude fingerprint, pin pad, bluetooth, and NFC.  All offer, and require cloud for at least setup.  Some use a gateway, others offer native WiFi

## Kidde Alarms  
- Kiddie is a well known manufacturer of traditional smoke, fire, and CO alarms.  They have recently begun offering WiFi equiped 110 volt AC alarms, some of which can also do air quality monitoring.  These devices can function as traditional alarms with a siren, but using the app offer typical smart home integration.
