## Initial Information Gathering
1. Decide on the device that will be analyzed
2. Find manufacturer information
   - Company
     - Parent Company?
   - Country of origin
3. Device Specifications
   - Hardware Interfaces: Identify all physical interfaces (e.g., USB, JTAG, Serial Ports) to assess potential physical access vulnerabilities.
   - Software Interfaces: Document all software interfaces (e.g., HTTP, SNMP) to understand exposure points.
4. Communication Protocols
   - Determine the protocols used (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee) and assess their security implications.
6. Platform/ecosystem
   - Does it use its own or a different companies
   - Is that platform hosted on a PaaS
7. Firmware Details:
   - Collect information on the device's firmware version and update history to evaluate potential vulnerabilities. 
9. Research Studies including this device.
   - Google Scholar or IEEE
   - Some other Database of case studies
10. Breach/Vulnerability Reports
     - CVSS database


## Analysis
1. Internet/Network Requirements
2. Cloud Requirements
   - Privacy
   - Bandwidth/performance
   - Feature set
3. Data Transmission Security
   - Assess whether data transmitted between the device and other entities is encrypted and follows secure protocols.
4. Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms
   - Evaluate the strength and implementation of user authentication and authorization controls.
5. Physical Security
   - Analyze the device's susceptibility to physical tampering or unauthorized access.
6. Data Storage Requirements
7. Data Gathering
   - Terms of Service
   - Case Studies
   - General Research
8. Compliance and Regulatory Standards
   - Check if the device adheres to relevant industry standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
9.  Company Vulnerability Remediation
   - CVSS database
   - Public Disclosures
   - Time Frame Between when Vulnerability was disclosed and Patch deployed
10. Company Vulnerability Transparency
     - Were patches silently deployed or publically shared
     - Were vulnerabilities disclosed publically, and how did the company respond
     - Company bug bounty programs


## Scoring
The higher the score the better

1. Place scores in the matrix  
    ## Example
    ### Camera X
    | Category | Score | Reasoning/Sources |
    | :------: | :---: | :-------: |
    | Requires Constant Internet Connection | Yes | Reasoning |
    | Requires Constant Connection to Company Cloud Infrastructure | No | Reasoning |
    | Data Storage Risk Score | Hybrid | Reasoning |
    | Data Gathering Risk Score | 3 | Reasoning |
    | Company Vulnerability Remediation Score | 2 | Reasoning |
    | Company Vulnerability Transparency Score | 4 | Reasoning |

2. Provide a total scoring at the bottom of the matrix
3. Give a summary describing the product, the manufacturer, platform, and reasoning for the score.
4. Give final recommendations
