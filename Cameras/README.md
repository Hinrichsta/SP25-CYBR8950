| Device Score-Category |  Rating | Description of Ratings | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Requires Constant Internet Connection | Yes | While there is local storage in cameras it cannot be accessed.  All video must be stored and accessed from the internet. |
| Requires Constant Connection to Company Cloud Infrastructure | Yes | The only location that you can access the videos is from the Google Nest/Home apps, and all video is constantly uploaded there for analysis for events. |
| Data Storage Requirements | Cloud | Local storage is minimal, is used for when there is network or power loss, and cannot be accessed.  All video must be stored in the cloud to be usuable |
| Data Gathering Risk Score | 1 | Google is always gathering data, and notoriously gathers as much as possible.  They utilize video sent to their cloud to grow their services and to gather data on their users.  Once you are a part of the ecosystem everything you do with that account is tracked even beyond just the cameras |
| Company Vulnerability Remediation Score | 3 | Google purchased Nest back in 2014, and suffered a major breach of all customers 5 years later.  They appear to be on top of their security since then, but you cannot check their updates prior to 2022 |
| Company Vulnerability Transparency Score | 3 | Their bug bounty program is great and is quite active both from the user and company point of view.  They are lacking in notifications prior to 2022 which is concerning that these started 3 years after their major breach.  They do post all of their updates with the CVE number that can be checked and verified. | 

## [Wyze Cameras](Cameras\Wyze-Analysis.md)
| Device Score-Category |  Rating | Description of Ratings | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Requires Constant Internet Connection | Yes | There is local storage but it cannot be viewed without using the Wyze app |
| Requires Constant Connection to Company Cloud Infrastructure | Yes | The only location that video can be viewed from is the Wyze app, or the browser web view if you have a subscription |
| Data Storage Requirements | Hybrid | Data can be stored locally, and required if you do not have a subscription.  With a subscription both can be achieved |
| Data Gathering Risk Score | 4 | Overall they only gather data from their products, and through their connections to third party.  They do not sell data in anyway and it is primarily used for internal information.  The Facial recognition data does NOT require consent from those being recorded, but all data is deleted after 30 days |
| Company Vulnerability Remediation Score | 2 | They did not start disclosing vulnerabilities until about 2022 when they had their first major breach.  Since then they have done better with disclosures and making sure that the information is shared.  Their bug bounty program while existent is lacking. |
| Company Vulnerability Transparency Score | 1 | They do not make any effort to put their vulnerability patches into their patch notes.  Instead they are put into a seperate location in their forums that is difficult to find.  It does appear that it is getting updated, but you wouldn't know it without regularly checking.  They also do not appear to have been disclosing anything before 2022 which is an issue to start. |
