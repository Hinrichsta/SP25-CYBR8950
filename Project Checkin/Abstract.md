## abstract (so far)

Consumers increasingly adopt IoT devices for convenience and automation, yet many remain unaware of the security risks associated with always-online connectivity. Smart home devices such as cameras, appliances, home automation, and entertainment systems are vulnerable due to weak security protocols, poor update policies, and unchanged default settings, exposing users to data breaches and unauthorized access. This project develops a security-focused IoT buying guide to help consumers make informed decisions by identifying high-risk device categories, analyzing vulnerabilities like default credentials and unencrypted data, evaluating manufacturer security practices, and providing best practices for secure device management. Our research addresses which IoT devices pose the highest risks, the most common security flaws, and how manufacturers handle updates and default settings. We systematically analyze security reports, documented vulnerabilities, and manufacturer policies to assess security weaknesses and transparency in consumer protection. Our findings highlight the need for stronger consumer awareness and proactive security measures, encouraging industry improvements in IoT security while helping users mitigate risks and protect their privacy.
