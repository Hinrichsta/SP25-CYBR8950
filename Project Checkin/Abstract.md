## Abstract

The growing popularity of IoT devices offers consumers convenience and automation. But, at the same time, it introduces security risks that many users overlook. Our research examines smart home devices such as cameras, appliances, home automation, and entertainment systems that are vulnerable due to weak security protocols, poor update policies, and unchanged default settings. These vulnerabilities expose users to data breaches, personal data theft, and unauthorized access. Our research project develops a security-focused IoT buying guide to help consumers make informed decisions by identifying high-risk device categories, analyzing vulnerabilities like default credentials and unencrypted data, evaluating manufacturer security practices, and providing best practices for secure device management. We systematically analyzed security reports, documented vulnerabilities, disclosures, and manufacturer updates & policies to assess security weaknesses and transparency in consumer protection. Our findings highlight the need for stronger consumer awareness and proactive security measures, encouraging industry improvements in IoT security while helping users mitigate risks and protect their privacy.
