#### working thoughts

Consumers increasingly adopt IoT devices for convenience and automation in their homes, yet many remain unaware of the security risks associated with always-online connectivity. Smart home devices such as cameras, appliances, home automation, and entertainment devices are particularly vulnerable due to weak security protocols, poor update policies, and unchanged default settings, exposing users to data breaches, unauthorized access, and cyber threats. 

This project develops a security-focused IoT buying guide to help consumers make informed decisions. It aims to: (1) identify IoT device categories that pose security risks and assess their impact on privacy and security, (2) analyze common vulnerabilities such as default credentials, unencrypted data, and inadequate security updates, (3) evaluate manufacturer security practices, including update policies and default configurations, and (4) provide best practices for selecting, configuring, and maintaining secure IoT devices. Our research addresses three key questions: Which IoT devices present the highest security risks? What are the most common security flaws? How do manufacturers handle security updates and default settings, and what are the implications for consumers?

To achieve this, we systematically analyze IoT security risks using documented vulnerabilities, security reports, and manufacturer policies, assessing key security weaknesses such as default credentials, unencrypted data transmissions, and inconsistent patching strategies. Additionally, we evaluate manufacturer transparency regarding security updates and consumer protection measures. Our findings emphasize the need for stronger consumer awareness and proactive security measures when selecting, configuring, and maintaining IoT devices. By offering a practical, security-oriented buying guide, we empower consumers to make informed decisions, mitigate cybersecurity risks, and encourage industry improvements in IoT security practices. This work contributes to broader efforts in enhancing smart home security and protecting user privacy in an increasingly connected world.


## abstract (so far)

Consumers increasingly adopt IoT devices for convenience and automation, yet many remain unaware of the security risks associated with always-online connectivity. Smart home devices such as cameras, appliances, home automation, and entertainment systems are vulnerable due to weak security protocols, poor update policies, and unchanged default settings, exposing users to data breaches and unauthorized access. This project develops a security-focused IoT buying guide to help consumers make informed decisions by identifying high-risk device categories, analyzing vulnerabilities like default credentials and unencrypted data, evaluating manufacturer security practices, and providing best practices for secure device management. Our research addresses which IoT devices pose the highest risks, the most common security flaws, and how manufacturers handle updates and default settings. We systematically analyze security reports, documented vulnerabilities, and manufacturer policies to assess security weaknesses and transparency in consumer protection. Our findings highlight the need for stronger consumer awareness and proactive security measures, encouraging industry improvements in IoT security while helping users mitigate risks and protect their privacy in an increasingly connected world.
