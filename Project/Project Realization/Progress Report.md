# Progress Report May 6, 2025
## Overview
Over the past several weeks while working on milestone 3 our research group focused on developing, reviewing, and finalizing a consumer-friendly IoT security buying guide with justifications and research. Meeting twice a week as a group and once per week with the instructor. The research group concentrated on turning our research and rubric into practical best practices that align with real-world concerns, security frameworks, and current compliance standards. Our group used comparisons with standards from OWASP, NIST, GDPR, CCPA and  IASME to ensure that the guidance was both accurate and actionable. These efforts helped convert our technical evaluation into a useful public-facing resource for non-technical users. The research paper guide has been structured for final publication and will be posted to a public non-peer reviewed site

## Outcomes
The research group achieved several key milestones across weeks 5â€“10:
- Included actionable guidance based on real-world vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
- Created a draft README with instructions and table of contents for user navigation.
- Refined and peer-reviewed each recommendation for clarity, technical accuracy, and accessibility.
- Designed a scoring matrix visualization and markdown structure for GitHub publication.
- Incorporated industry-aligned frameworks like OWASP IoT Top 10, GDPR, CCPA, NISTIR 8259, UL 2900 into the research paper and guide. 
- Developed a detailed set of consumer best practices for evaluating and purchasing IoT devices.
- Validated manufacturer security practices and provided examples using case studies.
- Began final proofreading and formatting for public release.

## Hinderances
Some challenges that were encountered  include aligning consumer-focused language with technical accuracy, but still referencing standards that are usually more technical in nature. Ensuring our recommendations were both compliant and understandable took multiple revisions. 

Gathering consistent vulnerability data across all vendors was difficult due to lack of public disclosures. The group overcame this challenge by combing through CVE databases, industry articles, and manufacturer documentation.
