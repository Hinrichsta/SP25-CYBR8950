# Progress Report 4/6/2025
## Overview
The group has created an analysis method and rubric for analysing the various devices that we are looking at to better lay out what we are presenting.  We have formalized the 4 categories of IoT devices, and then we each took one category expanding into individual devices within those categories.  With our devices decided on we gathered case studies on each for referential data to better expound upon our findings.  We then gathered information provided by the manufacturers and other sources regarding weaknesses/vulnerabilities and the manufacturer practices regarding security and data privacy.

## Outcomes
- We formalized the categories of the IoT devices that we will be looking at to better breakdown or work.
- We created a method of analyzing the devices and then created the rubric that we will be utilizing to score each device.
- Decided upon the 4 devices from each category that we will be putting through our analysis method.
- Each of us took the devices for our categories and did initial research and case study gathering for them.
- Manufacturer data gathered regarding their disclosures for the devices that we will be analyzing.
- We gathered data for each device from CVE databases, searching for disclosures specific to the devices or networks that the devices use.
- We drafted the scoring matrices for each of the device categories to support the visual scoring framework.
- The draft diagram of the process flow for analyzing each device was created, to be further refined for the final report.

## Hinderances
We ran into some issues regarding how we would like to approach the overall analysis of the project.  To get past this we all took which way we would prefer to go and came to the group with our points for one way or another.  We cooperatively decided on what the best way forward with the project was, and started moving forward with it.

We have run into issues deciding on what devices to go with for a couple of categories.  It was brought to the attention of the group and we brainstormed more ideas, and we able to add a couple of suggestions to each list before formalization.

Data gathering on some of this can be sparse at best, and sometimes is non-existent due to manufacturers not disclosing.  There is also the opposite affect where sometimes there are so many different reports out there that finding specific ones can be difficult.  This is overcome by sharing the issues with the group, and everyone making a collective effort to help find the appropriate articles.

## Ongoing Risks
|Risk name (value)  | Impact (1-5) | Likelihood (1-5) | Update |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| Meeting Scheduling (9) | 3 | 3 | We have regularly scheduled meetings that have only been missed due to weather causing major outages. |
| Research and Data Collection (12)| 4 | 3 | Data gathering has not had any major issues, there has been some minor difficulties but nothing stopping progress. |
| Scope Creep (15) | 3 | 5 | We had to adjust our timeline to better fit what we wanted to do, but we are currently on track to complete in the time originally alotted. |
| Communication (6) | 3 | 2 | Communication has not been an issue for this group overall.  We keep in regular communication through various means and do good to keep each other informed of our progress. |
| Evolving Standards (12) | 4 | 3 | Standards stagnation has not been an issue, and the overall field has not had much change during this project. |
