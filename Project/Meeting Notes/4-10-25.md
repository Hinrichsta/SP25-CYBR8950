# Meeting Notes â€“ 04/10/2025

- Reviewed comments on our presentation and discussed if we wanted to make any changes.
- Discussed CVE data comment, which we did, but OWASP we did not do, but we can see if we get any hits on our devices, but out of scope as it is too high level.
- CWE's can be paired with disclosures.
- Specifically discussed the comment on isolating them to a network, which would be beyond the ability of most consumers, and would change the risk of the device as far as privacy is concerned as we are looking at the device itself vs. overall risk to your enviroment.
- 3rd party firmware is out of scope, like HomeAssistant as it is beyond consumer capability, but we will include these thoughts as a next step if someone would like to do further research.
- Discussed the Final Paper
    - Created a Template for it to get started on.
- Reviewed Kanban board and updated to ready.
    - Reviewed what had been completed, and moved the next steps into their appropriate locations.
## Next Steps
- Tyler will take care of copying my ACM template to his OneDrive, since we have used that thus far.
- Finish up Week 5/6 and get moving on Week 6/7
    - Try to have your initial findings for each device ready by next Thursday.
