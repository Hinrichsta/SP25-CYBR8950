## Smart Fridge 
- Samsung Smart Refrigerator, since this is manufactered by a well known company it is interesting to see how often they are involved in vulnerability discussions.
- Beko Smart Fridge manufacturer'Arçelik' is one of the first companies to push the IASME IoT Security Assured certification for their connected refrigerator.
- Smart fridges should be included in this IoT Buyer’s Guide due to their security vulnerabilities. This includes risks like SSL misconfiguration and botnet attacks. They also pose privacy concerns, as they collect and store user data in the cloud. Many models depend on an always-on internet connection, which can cause issues if manufacturers discontinue cloud services.
- As with many IoT devices, limited security update lifecycles can leave devices vulnerable over time. As major point of the guide a lack of consumer awareness leads to poor security practices, which increases the risk of cyber threats.
- ### Concerns
   - Smart refrigerators have been identified as potential targets for cyberattacks. For instance, vulnerabilities in certain models have allowed unauthorized access, leading to concerns about data breaches and unauthorized control. 
   - Access to smart fridge technology controlled by IoS and Android apps could lead to unauthorized access. Many devices are shipped with default usernames and passwords, which users often neglect to change, making them susceptible to unauthorized access.
   - Some appliances transmit data without encryption, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive information.
- ### Case Studies
   - In 2014, a large-scale cyberattack leveraged over 100,000 smart devices, including refrigerators, to form a botnet. This network was used to send approximately 750,000 malicious emails over a two-week period. The incident highlighted the potential risks associated with unsecured IoT appliances and the ease with which they can be exploited for malicious purposes. https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/mobile-security/internet-of-things-cyberattack/
   - Research conducted by VTO Labs revealed that smart refrigerators could store extensive information about their owners. This data retention poses privacy risks, as unauthorized access to the appliance could lead to the exposure of sensitive personal information. The findings underscore the need for robust security measures to protect consumer data in IoT devices. https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/08/1072708/hack-smart-fridge-digital-forensics/
